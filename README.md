Adaptive Optimization Framework for Control and Verification of Cyber Physical Systems.

We present an optimization-based framework for control and verification of cyber-physical systems that synthesizes actions steering a given system towards a specified state. We demonstrate that our algorithm can be applied to any system modeled as a controllable Markov decision process equipped with a cost (reward) function. A key feature of the procedure we propose is its automatic adaptation to the performance of optimization towards a given global objective. Combining model-predictive control and ideas from sequential Monte-Carlo methods, we introduce a performance-based adaptive horizon and implicitly build a Lyapunov function that guarantees convergence. Experiments on two model problems, birds reaching a V-formation from an arbitrary configuration and covering an arbitrary area by a team of drones, illustrate successful application of our framework. Statistical model-checking is used to verify our algorithm and assess its reliability.
